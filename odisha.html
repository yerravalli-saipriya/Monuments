      The history of Konark Sun Temple and sun worship goes as far back as the 19th century BC. The Konark Sun Temple, however, was built in the 13th century. The historic region of Kalinga which comprises major parts of modern-day Odisha and several parts of Chhatisgarh, Andhra Pradesh, and West Bengal, was ruled by the rulers of the Eastern Ganga Dynasty from 5th Century AD to 15th Century AD. It was one of the most powerful dynasties in India which gave existence to majestic temples like Konark Sun Temple and Puri Jagannath Temple.

The Konark Temple was built by King Narasimha Deva I in 1244 to worship Surya, the Sun God. Konark was chosen as its place of construction because it has been described as the holy seat of Surya in various ancient texts.
Pope Pius XII raised this sanctuary to the status of basilica via the Pontifical decree “Priscam Goae” on 20 March 1946. The decree was signed and notarized by Cardinal Giovanni Battista Montini.

      The temple was rebuilt by the King of the Eastern Ganga dynasty, Anantavarman Chodaganga, in the 10th century CE, as described by the Kendupatna copper-plate inscription of his descendant, Narasimhadeva II. was originally a Shaivite, and became a Vaishnavite sometime after he conquered the Utkala region, in which the temple is located, in 1112 CE. A 1134–1135 CE inscription records his donation to the temple. Therefore, the temple construction must have started sometime after 1112 CE

      In the year 272 B.C. the great Maurya dynasty's legendary king "Ashoka the Great" looked down from over the vast expanse of the battle field of Kalinga (now the area around Dhauli) littered with bodies after a fierce battle. Even after a well-fought victory, the sight of the aftermath of the war, death and destruction horrified him and resulted in Ashoka's transformation.

He channeled his energy, which he spent earlier in winning wars and conquering, in spiritual pursuit. He became a Buddhist and started following Buddha’s teachings and austere ways of leading life. All the destruction made him think about the ephemeral nature of all earthly things and the utter uselessness of running after the earthly possessions which cease after death.

    <p id="Barabati Fort">
      <b>Location:</b>Cuttack, Odisha<br/>
      <b>Built By:</b>Maharaja Markata Keshari <br />
      <b>Architecture style:</b> distinctive<br />
      <b>Year of construction: </b>987 CE<br />
      The Barabati was built in 987 CE by the Somavamshi dynasty lineage ruler Maharaja Markata Keshari while building a stone embankment to protect Cuttack which was known as Kataka at that time.

Scholars give different opinions regarding the date of construction of Barabati fort. Madalapanji, the Jagannatha temple chronicle narrates an interesting story which is as follows.

King Anangabhima Deva III of the Eastern Ganga dynasty lived in his capital, Chaudwar (1211-1238 A.D.) One day the king crossed the Mahanadi and came towards the southern side. Here he noticed in the Barabati village belonging to the Ko-danda sub-division that near the god Visweswar, a heron had jumped upon a hawk. Seeing this the king was very much surprised and on an auspicious day laid the foundation of construction of the fort and this village was named Barabati Cuttack. And after that he left Choudwar and lived at Cuttack making it his capital.
