      The Kamrup Kamakhya Temple, or the Kamakhya Temple, is one of the oldest
      Hindu temples in Guwahati, Assam, and the subcontinent. The temple is on
      Nilachal hills. It is one of the oldest and most revered places where
      Tantric practices are done. It is named after the mother goddess Kamakhya.
      According to Sanatan Dharm, the Kamakhya Temple was created when Hindu
      Goddess Parvati ordered Lord Shiva to build a shrine for her so that she
      could meditate in peace until she found a suitable husband for herself.
      The place was found where the Ambubachi Mela is held every year to honour
      the Goddessâ€™s periods.

      Agnigarh is a hillock located in Tezpur, Assam, India.In Hindu scriptures, it is the site of the fortress which was built by Banasura to keep his daughter Usha in isolation. The name itself is derived from the words 'Agni' meaning fire and 'garh' meaning fortress or wall in Sanskrit. Usha fell in love with Aniruddha in her dreams, not knowing that he was the grandson of Krishna. Her companion Chitralekha identified him by painting his portrait from Usha's description. Chitralekha Udyan in Tezpur also known as 'Cole Park,' the biggest park in Tezpur, is named after her. Chitralekha was not only an artist but one possessing mystical powers. Anirudddha was Krishna's grandson and Usha, the daughter of an Asura king, therefore was no way any side would consent to their love.

      Sri Surya Pahar is located about 12 km southeast of Goalpara, about 132 km northwest of Guwahati, is a significant but relatively unknown archaeological site in Assam, India. Goalpara is the nearest city from the site. The site is a hilly terrain where several rock-cut Shivalingas, votive stupas and the deities of Hindu, Buddhist and Jain pantheon are scattered in an area of about one km. The site is centered on the hills (Pahar) of Sri Surya which is profusely filled up with Shiva Lingas (Lingam). People have found 99999 Shiva Lingas were engraved here by Vyasa in order to build up a second Kashi (where there were 1,00000 Shiva Lingas) and once it was one of the holiest pilgrimage sites in the region. There is no historical evidence exactly how many Lingams once dotted in these hills, but still there are hundreds of them, from tiny to large in size, scattered everywhere at the foot of the hill and covering the extensive area after centuries of neglect and pilferage.
