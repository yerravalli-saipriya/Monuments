      Amber was a Meena state, ruled by a Susawat clan. After Kakil Deo defeated
      the Susawats he made Amber the capital of Dhundhar after Khoh. Kakil Deo
      was a son of Dulherai. In early times, the state of Jaipur was known as
      Amber or Dhundhar and was controlled by Meena chiefs of five different
      tribes. They were under suzerainty of the Bargurjar Rajput Raja of Deoti.
      Later a Kachhwaha prince, Dulha Rai, destroyed the sovereignty of Meenas
      and also defeated Bargurjars of Deoli and took Dhundhar fully under
      Kachwaha rule.[21] The Amber Fort was originally built by Raja Man Singh.
      Jai Singh I expanded it in the early 1600's. Improvements and additions
      were made by successive rulers over the next 150 years, until the
      Kachwahas shifted their capital to Jaipur during the time of Sawai Jai
      Singh II, in 1727.

      Amer was known in the ancient and medieval period as Dhundhar (meaning
      attributed to a sacrificial mount in the western frontiers). which was
      ruled by Meenas before 10th century AD. What is known in the present day
      as Jaigarh Fort, which was actually the main defensive structure rather
      than the palace itself. The two structures are interconnected by a series
      of encompassing fortifications and ruled by the Kachwahas from the 10th
      century onwards. The history of Amer and Jaigarh is indelibly linked to
      these rulers, as they founded their empire at Amer.

    <p id="Nahargarh Fort">
      <b>Location:</b> Jaipur, Rajasthan<br />
      <b>Built By:</b>Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II<br />
      <b>Architecture style:</b> Indo-European architectural style<br />
      <b>Year of construction: </b>1973<br />
      Built mainly in 1734 by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh, the king of Jaipur, the
      fort was constructed as a place of retreat on the summit of the ridge
      above the city. Walls extended over the surrounding hills, forming
      fortifications that connected this fort to Jaigarh, the fort above the old
      capital of Amber. Though the fort never came under attack during the
      course of its history, it did see some historical events, notably, the
      treaties with the Maratha forces who warred with Jaipur in the 18th
      century. During the Indian Mutiny of 1857, the Europeans of the region,
      including the British Resident's wife, were moved to Nahargarh fort by the
      king of Jaipur, Sawai Ram Singh, for their protection. The fort was
      extended in 1868, during the reign of Sawai Ram Singh. In 1883-92, a range
      of palaces was built at Nahargarh by Dirgh Patel at a cost of nearly three
      and a half lakh rupees. The Madhavendra Bhawan, built by Sawai Madho Singh
      had suites for the queens of Jaipur and at the head was a suite for the
      king himself. The rooms are linked by corridors and still have some
      delicate frescoes. Nahargarh was also a hunting residence of the Maharajas

    <h1>4. Lake Palace</h1>

      <b>Architecture style:</b>Mughal architectural<br />
      <b>Year of construction: </b>1743<br />
      The Lake Palace was built between 1743 and 1746 under the direction of the
      Maharana Jagat Singh IIof Udaipur, Rajasthan as a summer palace. It was
      initially called Jagniwas or Jan Niwas after its founder. The palace was
      constructed facing east, allowing its inhabitants to pray to Surya, the
      Hindu sun god, at the crack of dawn.Jagat Singh felt that the City Palace
      was too public to invite the beautiful young ladies of Udaipur with
      decadent, moonlit picnics. Therefore a palace in the centre of Lake
      Pichola would offer a lot more privacy.The successive rulers used this
      palace as their summer resort, holding their regal durbars in its
      courtyards lined with columns, pillared terraces, fountains, and gardens.
      The walls are made of black and white marbles and are adorned by
      semi-precious stones and ornamented niches. Gardens, fountains, pillared
      terraces and columns line its courtyards.
