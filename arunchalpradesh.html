The Dalai Lama gave him a painting of goddess Palden Lhamo to be kept in the monastery. The 8 m high glided statue of Lord Buddha dominates the sanctum. The great rotating prayer wheels, priceless thangkas, the drone of monks in prayer, sputtering butter lamps are an evocative vision. The Tawang Monastery has a residential building for the monks, a library, a museum and school for the basic education.

    <p id="Gompa Temple">
      <b>Location:</b>Itanagar, Arunachal Pradesh<br />

      <b>Year of construction: </b>7th century<br />
      The Gompa sits on top of the hill literally. A small but colorful gate marks the entrance of the Gompa. A white stupa with golden carvings stood just outside the main Gompa and against the backdrop of green rolling hills, it looked very beautiful. The main Gompa is a typical Gompa, but one of the smaller ones I had seen. There was no one inside when I went there, though later a monk came out of the monastery and I asked if it was ok to photograph the interior. To my surprise he was quite casual with being photographed. The location of the Gompa and the way it sat pretty on top was most remarkable. You could go around the back of the gompa and view the whole town. The peak offers a 360 degree view.
