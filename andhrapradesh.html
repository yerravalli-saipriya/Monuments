      The Madhavaraya Temple, also known as the Madhava Perumal Temple, is an

      reference to the temple is found in 16th century inscriptions. Several
      16th century inscriptions from the Vijayanagara period have been
      discovered at Gandikota. The Madhavaraya Temple, devoted to Lord Vishnu,
      is said to have been founded during the rule of Sri Krishna Deva Raya of
      the Vijayanagara Kingdom. It stands as the most remarkable edifice in
      Gandikota, and quite possibly, the entire region. The temple has Kalyana
      Mandapam, Ranga Mandapam, panashala in the south-east corner,
      alankarashala, Alvarula temple in the north and Sri Madhavaraya Swamy
      temple with 55 pillars.
